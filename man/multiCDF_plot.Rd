\title{Multiple CDF Plot For Continuous Variables
Using ggplot2}
\usage{
multiCDF_plot(x, seq_length, distributions)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The variable to for which to plot PDFs}

\item{seq_length}{The number of points over which to fit x}

\item{distributions}{The distributions to fit x against}
}
\value{
A dataframe with x, the real density, and the pdf of the desired
distributions with length(nrow) equal to seq_length +1.
}
\description{
This function returns a ggplot output showing the CDFs for selected distributions
against a continuous, non-negative input variable. Possible distributions include "normal",
"lognormal", "gamma", "exponential", "cauchy", "t", "weibull", "logistic",
and "all".
